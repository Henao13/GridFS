## Security Features

GridFS includes the following security features:

- **User Authentication**: All operations require user registration and login
- **Session Management**: Secure session tokens for authenticated users
- **File Ownership**: Users can only delete files they own
- **Input Validation**: All gRPC messages are validated
- **Error Handling**: Sensitive information is not exposed in error messages

## Best Practices for Deployment

When deploying GridFS in production:

1. **Network Security**:
   - Use VPC with private subnets for internal communication
   - Restrict Security Groups to necessary ports only
   - Use HTTPS/TLS for external communication

2. **Access Control**:
   - Implement strong password policies
   - Consider integrating with external authentication systems
   - Regularly audit user accounts and permissions

3. **Data Protection**:
   - Encrypt data at rest in DataNode storage
   - Use encrypted communication channels
   - Regular backups of critical data

4. **Monitoring**:
   - Monitor logs for suspicious activities
   - Set up alerts for unusual access patterns
   - Regular security audits

5. **Updates**:
   - Keep all components updated with latest security patches
   - Subscribe to security notifications for dependencies
